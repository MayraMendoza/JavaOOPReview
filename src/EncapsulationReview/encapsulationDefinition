encapsulation - is the inclusion of all methods and variables needed for a java object to function, contained within the object iteself.

(in capsule/ like a pill) in java all the setting of variables of a class
is inside a method.
The point of encapsulation is to abstract the variables from the user to make it simpler.
make a set/get method because they are private.
