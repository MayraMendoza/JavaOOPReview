Inheritance is a concept that acquires the properties from one class to another class.
using methods and properties from a generic class and making different versions of them.
One example is the relationship between father and son. Inheritance in Java is a process of acquiring all thr behaviours of a parent object.

Types of Inheritance
single Inheritance - in single inheritance, subclasses inherit the features of one superclass/parent class.

Multilevel Inheritance - in Multilevel Inheritance, a derived class will be inheriting a base/parent class and as well as the derived
class also acts as the base/parent class for other classes.
Example A is base/super class for the derived class B--- which can serve as a base/parent class for another class (C)
B extends A
C extends B (C will inherit all of A & B methods)
