Abstraction - a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increased efficiency.

objects in an OOP language provide an abstraction that hides the internal implementation details. you just need to know 
which methods of the object are available to call and which input parameters are needed to trigger a specific operation. 
you do not need to understand how this method is implemented and which kind of actions it has to perform to create the expected result.
an example is a car accelerating - you need to know acceleration but do not need to know how the engine/spark plugs are all firing 
in order to hit on the accelerator and make the car move.
