Polymorphism- Means many forms (of a method).
Java class can do the same thing in different ways.
override - example original bird can sign by going "tweet tweet tweet". But not all birds will sing the same.
when extending the bird class to robin or pelican you can override sing method from the parent class. to override you
have to implement the exact same method signature as the parent method.

(Method in the child class override a method in the parent class) (resulting in doing the same thing in a different form)


Other form of polymorphism METHOD OVERLOADING
when you have two methods in a class with the same name but take different parameters.
you cant have the same exact methods but you can have many methods with the same name that take different parameters.
